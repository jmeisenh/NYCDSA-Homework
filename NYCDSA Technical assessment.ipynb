    "Question 1: Determine the perimeter of the lake\n",
    "\n",
    "First approximation:\n",
    "    If only a rough measure of the circumference of the lake is needed, the simplest method is to divide the lake into regular component shapes with easily determined lengths (Rectangles, triangles, and semi-circles). This method would only be applicable if a very gross measurement of circumference is needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Second Approximation:\n",
    "    String method: Take a string and simply lay it around the lake. This method will get much closer to the true circumference, however if a significant portion of the lake has 'ridges and nooks' the string measureing method will still only be an approximation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Third Approximation:\n",
    "    If full arial photography is availible, a program can be written to determine the circumference. \n",
    "    - Define the space of the simulation. A simple rectangle around the lake would be ideal\n",
    "    - Divide the space into a regular grid\n",
    "    - Generate a large number of random points of known coordinates on the grid\n",
    "    - the color of the lake appears relatively uniform, and differs significantly from the surrounding land and can therefore be used to determine if a random point is 'in the lake' or outside of it\n",
    "    - Define the boundry conditions of the lake as any point that is in the lake and is adjacent to at least one point that is outside of the lake\n",
    "    - The circumference of the lake will be approximated by the product of the number of 'boundry points' and the hypotenuse of the right triangle defined by the grid size\n",
    "    - Run the simulation many times with decreasing size of grid squares\n",
    "    - Graph the results. The results should be approaching a certain value, the true circumference of the lake.\n"
